# Start Here

Welcome to CygNet's public GitHub repositories! If you want to learn more about these repositories, including how to contribute or use these repositories for your own projects.

## License

The repositories are provided under the 3-clause BSD license, which is available [here](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) and at each of the repository roots at LICENSE.txt, unless a different license is provided for technical reasons. It is recommended that you read and understand the implications of the license before working with the contents of the repositories.

## Support

CygNet will not give technical support for the contents of any of these repositories. These resources are provided for various reasons (including as examples or templates) but they are separate from the CygNet product. **Do not contact CygNet Support with questions about the contents of these repositories as they will probably have no clue what you are talking about**. Instead, [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) is the best way to ask for help. We cannot guarantee that the issues will be resolved.

## Contributing

You can contribute to any of these repositories by [submitting a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). Pull requests will be monitored by the owners of the repositories. Pull requests are more likely to be accepted if they improve the quality of the repository and are not overly nitpicky (an example of a pull request that might be rejected is one that changes the names of variables in a script to fit a certain naming convention). [Here](https://github.com/cygnet-software/CanvasDemoScreens/pull/1) is an example of a pull request which adds a Canvas screen, describing its usefulness and even has a file about how to use the screen.

### Larger Projects

There are two primary methods of code sharing we have identified:

1. CygNet software engineers posting snippets or projects for general consumption
2. SCADA admins posting snippets for other SCADA admins

If you have a project on GitHub and would like to share, submit an issue on this repository and it will be added to the "Links To Other Helpful Repositories" section below.
